  <FAQ Question="How do I add or remove a skill?"
         Answer="DXC should not want to receive another party’s confidential information because DXC will 
                 then have the burden to maintain that information as confidential, and DXC’s freedom of 
                 invention and action may be compromised because of knowing such confidential information. 
                 However, in situations where it is necessary for DXC to receive such sensitive information
                 from another party, a proper Confidential Disclosure Agreement (CDA) should be executed 
                 before receiving such information. Please refer to the “Receiving Sensitive Information” 
                 section in the &lt;a href=&quot; http://standards.int.hpe.com/policy/docs/hpe010-04.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DXC Confidential Information Policy&lt;/a&gt;.">
